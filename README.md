# TO RUN THE PROJECT FOLLOW THE STEPS:

1.cd client

2.npm i

3.npm run dev/npm start

# ABOUT OUR PROJECT:

A blockchain-based platform leveraging Ethereum smart contracts to ensure: 1.Transparent tracking of monetary and physical donations. 2.Verified transaction records and fund utilization updates. 3.Trust and accountability through immutable ledgers.

# HOW IT WORKS:

1.Full Transparency & Trust: Every donation is recorded on a public ledger (blockchain), ensuring that funds cannot be misused or altered. Donors can track their contributions in real time.

2.Proof of Donations: Donors get digital receipts or appreciation tokens that verify their contributions, making the process accountable and rewarding.

3.Easy to Use with Wallet Integration: Donors and NGOs can connect using simple digital wallets (like an online payment app), making the process as easy as sending money online.

4.Item Donations with Verification: Physical items like clothes or food are digitally recorded (like an online certificate), ensuring NGOs receive and distribute them properly.

5.Secure & Direct Transactions: Donations go directly to the NGOâ€™s digital wallet without middlemen, reducing fraud and ensuring the right people receive the funds.

# TECH STACKS USED:

1.Blockchain: Ethereum (Solidity, Ganache, Goerli/Sepolia testnets). 2.Frontend: React.js with web3.js or ethers.js for wallet integration.
